## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) 
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) 
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/) 

### What I learned

This project took me longer than the previous ones, mostly because I ran out of steam at some point and I was also working in different things at the same time. I also wanted it to be as ready as possible before I properly publish it, but that is not very realistic because then it'd never be done.
Oh yeah, the learning thingy, so I'd worked with Vue Router in the past so I had an idea on the way it work ed and what I could do with it, but it had been a long time since I had to implement routing from scratch so that was a cool thing to re-learn. 

### Continued development

Tests, like always. I need to add unit tests to this project. I also want to fix the jumpy thingy of the data in desktop when you change from one section or planet to the next one. Include Pluto, maybe? I know it's considered a dwarf planet now but I remember when we had 9 planets in the solar system so I kinda have an emotional attachment to that little bugger.
